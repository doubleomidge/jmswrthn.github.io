                    What was the worst site you came across during the 24 hour mobile browsing experience (list it's name and url)?<br>
                    Ilean 3.0 <br> http://byui.brightspace.com<br><br>
                    How did your best site differ from the worst in knowing who their target audience was?<br>
                    They both address the issue of who the target audience is but Ilearn seems to think the students use will be more casual then today mobile world is at the moment.<br><br>
                    How did your best site differ from the worst in meeting the needs of their audience?<br>
                    The first site is very informative on all layers of browsing wher as I learn will only meet the needs of anyone who only needs information from the home page or those who have more time than normal to access.<br><br>
                    How did your best site differ from the worst in organizing content to facilitate it being found?<br>
                    It is very organized at the atlas website with a search engine if it will be difficult, whereas Ilearn has the objective to hide information in a giant hierarchal tree of pages.<br><br>
                    How did your best site differ from the worst in facilitating visitors in a mobile environment?<br>
                    The atlas website was modified to keep all functionality in a mobile environment where as Ilearn adjustment was to hide feature that are often used by students and only provides ease of access to a summary of information.<br>
