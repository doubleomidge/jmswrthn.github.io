            <p>
                Haily , include current temp is recomended on all sizes, on the large screeen moving he low and high temps closer might or could be a good idea
                think about including hourly temp in the medium screen size, liked the accessibility of city links on the large page and the drop down on the other two
            </p>
            <p>
                In response to this feedback I added the hourly temp on the medium and large wireframes, also added current temp at the same time to help balance out the to far away high and low temp to make them feel conected into a whole instead of apearing as spread apart.
